            <h3>Insurance Cost Prediction App</h3>
            <p>
                A Flask-based web app that predicts US health insurance costs using an Azure-trained linear regression model with an RÂ² score of 0.95. 
                The model was trained on data from

            <h3>Capstone Design Project: Design and Optimization of a Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Approach - From Capture to Utilization in Northminster Field</h3>
            <p>
                A petroleum engineering capstone project completed as part of the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Regina, in collaboration with Abdulqadir Abdi. This project addressed Canadaâ€™s initiative to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by integrating COâ‚‚ capture from industrial sources with Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and sequestration in the depleted Northminster Field, Saskatchewan.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Methods:</strong> The workflow included: (1) Sourcing historical data via AccuMap, (2) Constructing a geological reservoir model, and (3) Utilizing CMG-GEM and CMOST for fluid modeling, history matching, and optimizing three COâ‚‚ injection schemes to balance oil recovery and carbon storage.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Results:</strong> The optimal scheme (Case 2) achieved 156,129 tons of COâ‚‚ sequestration and 52,302 barrels of oil production over the wellâ€™s life, with an injection rate of 82 tons/day. The net present value reached $57,000 with a $85/ton COâ‚‚ credit, underscoring the economic viability post-1995 with carbon tax incentives. Comparative trials showed varying oil output and COâ‚‚ injection efficiency.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Impact:</strong> This project demonstrated a sustainable approach to oil recovery while mitigating environmental impact, with potential applications in carbon credit markets.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Tools:</strong> AccuMap, CMG-GEM, CMOST, economic modeling<br/>

                <strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Grateful to Dr. Michael Dent (IDTechEx Research), faculty members, and external representatives Dr. Farshid Torabi and Dr. Sam Hong for guidance. Thanks to the University of Regina for resources.<br/>
