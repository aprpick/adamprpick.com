<h3>COâ‚‚ Enhanced Oil Recovery and Sequestration Feasibility Study</h3>
<p>
  A capstone project completed as part of the Petroleum Systems Engineering program at the University of Regina. 
  The objective was to evaluate the feasibility and economic potential of a COâ‚‚-based Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) 
  process combined with carbon sequestration in a depleted oil reservoir.
  <br/><br/>
  Using historical data from the Northminster Field in Saskatchewan, a geological model was constructed. 
  CMG-GEM and CMOST software were used for fluid modeling, history matching, and simulation of multiple COâ‚‚ injection strategies.
  The project optimized the injection rate (82 tons/day) to yield a cumulative sequestration of 156,129 tons of COâ‚‚ and production 
  of 52,302 barrels of oil. The outcome highlighted the importance of carbon tax incentives for feasibility post-1995.
  <br/><br/>
<strong>Tools:</strong> AccuMap, CMG-GEM, CMOST, economic modeling
